# NATS

EventMachine based Publish-Subscribe Messaging that just works.

## Supported Platforms

This gem currently works on the following Ruby platforms:

- MRI 1.8 and 1.9 (Performance is best on 1.9.2)
- Rubinius
- JRuby (not quite yet)

## Getting Started

    rake geminstall
    cd ./examples
    pub foo 'Hello World!'

## Usage
   
    require "nats/client"

    NATS.start do

      # Simple Subscriber
      NATS.subscribe('foo') { |msg| puts "Msg received : '#{msg}'" }

      # Simple Publisher
      NATS.publish('foo.bar.baz', 'Hello World!')

      # Publish with closure, callback fires when server has processed the message
      NATS.publish('foo', 'You done?') { puts 'msg processed!' }
      
      # Unsubscribing
      s = NATS.subscribe('bar') { |msg| puts "Msg received : '#{msg}'" }
      NATS.unsubscribe(s)

      # Request/Response

      # The helper
      NATS.subscribe('help') do |msg, reply|
        NATS.publish(reply, "I'll help!")
      end

      # Help request
      NATS.request('help') { |response|
        puts "Got a response: '#{response}'"
      }

      # Wildcard Subscriptions

      # '*" matches any token
      NATS.subscribe('foo.*.baz') { |msg, _, sub| puts "Msg received on [#{sub}] : '#{msg}'" }

      # '>" can only be last token, and matches to any depth
      NATS.subscribe('foo.>') { |msg, _, sub| puts "Msg received on [#{sub}] : '#{msg}'" }


      # Stop using NATS.stop, exits EM loop if NATS.start started it
      NATS.stop

    end
